🦠 COVID-19 Mortality Analysis (R Project)
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes COVID-19 mortality data to identify key demographic risk factors associated with death outcomes.
Using R and statistical analysis, the study explores how age, gender, time, and geographic location influence mortality rates.

The project was developed as part of a data analytics portfolio, focusing on data cleaning, hypothesis testing, and data visualization.

🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess raw COVID-19 patient data

Calculate overall and subgroup mortality rates

Compare mortality by age and gender using statistical tests

Visualize mortality trends over time

Identify high-risk age groups, genders, and countries

📊 Dataset

Source: COVID-19 line-list dataset

Type: Patient-level epidemiological data

Key Variables:

age

gender

country

death (binary outcome)

reporting.date

Missing age values were imputed using the mean age, and non-analytical metadata columns were removed.

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

Converted the death variable into a binary format (0 = alive, 1 = deceased)

Imputed missing age values using the mean

Rounded age values for grouping

Removed irrelevant metadata columns

Converted reporting dates to proper date format

📈 Analysis Performed
1. Age vs Mortality

Compared mean ages of deceased and surviving patients

Conducted a Welch Two-Sample t-test (99% confidence level)

2. Gender vs Mortality

Calculated death rates by gender

Performed a t-test to assess gender disparity

3. Time Series Analysis

Visualized daily COVID-19 deaths over time using line plots

4. Age Group Analysis

Categorized ages into:

0–20

21–40

41–60

61–80

81+

Identified the most vulnerable age groups

5. Geographical Analysis

Compared death counts across countries

Highlighted countries with higher mortality counts

6. Age & Gender Interaction

Examined how mortality varies jointly by age group and gender

🧠 Key Findings

Age is the strongest risk factor: mortality peaks in the 61–80 age group

Gender disparity exists:

Male death rate ≈ 8.5%

Female death rate ≈ 3.7%

Males consistently show higher mortality across all age groups

China reports the highest number of deaths in the dataset

Deaths peak early in the timeline, followed by a sharp decline

📌 Recommendations

Prioritize healthcare protection for individuals over 60 years old

Allocate medical resources to high-risk demographics during outbreaks

Conduct further research into biological and behavioral factors behind gender differences in mortality
